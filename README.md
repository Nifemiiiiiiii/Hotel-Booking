### Insights & Recommendations

3. Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Adjust prices based on seasonality and demand fluctuations.
4. Enhance Customer Retention: Loyalty programs for frequent guests to encourage repeat bookings.
5. Optimize Marketing Efforts: Focus on business travelers for city hotels and vacationers for resorts.
6. Improve Operational Efficiency: Predict peak periods for better staffing and resource allocation.
7. Hotels should clearly define meal options (e.g., breakfast included, half-board, full-board) to avoid confusion and dissatisfaction.
For example, provide detailed descriptions of what each meal plan includes (e.g., "Breakfast includes a continental buffet with fresh pastries, fruits, and beverages").
8. Offer Customizable Meal Plans: Introduce customizable meal plans to cater to different customer preferences.
For example, allow guests to choose between BB, HB, or FB based on their needs, and offer add-ons like Ã  la carte options or special dietary meals (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
